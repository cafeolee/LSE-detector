# Spanish Sign Language (LSE) detector

## About the project
This project is a prototype of a Spanish Sign Language (LSE) detector focused on recognizing static letters of the Spanish fingerspelling alphabet using computer vision and machine learning.

In this version of the project, only static letters are supported. Dynamic letters are not yet implemented. The goal of this initial version is to establish a solid and accurate foundation, with the intention of extending the system to support the full alphabet in future updates.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was created from images obtained from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kirlelea/spanish-sign-language-alphabet-static).

It contains 19 folders with around 100 images each, for each static letter of the LSE fingerspelling alphabet, that are the following: **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U**.
